# Bugs (history)

Fixed bugs, archived from `BUGS.md` so the active list stays scannable
on session start. **Archaeological**: read only when consulted, not at
session start. When a bug is fixed, append its entry here rather than
to the active file.

The bug breakout file at `bugs/<slug>.md` (when present) stays in place
as the historical diagnosis record; the entry here is a brief
description of the fix and the commit it landed in.

## Cross-reference resolution

`/nightshift:ready` does **not** scan this file. When a bug is fixed, every other
`**Requires:**` line in `FEATURES.md` / `BUGS.md` that referenced it is
edited at the same time to drop the now-satisfied reference (mirror of
the `FEATURES.md` convention). The active `Requires:` lines therefore
describe what is *currently* blocking; this file is purely
archaeological.
