# Bugs

Known bugs awaiting attention. Short entries live here; bugs that need
more than a few lines of description graduate to a dedicated file under
`.claude/bugs/<slug>.md`.

This file is **one of four repo-local indexes** agents consult on demand
when relevant (alongside `QUICK_WINS.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `PATTERNS.md`).
When a bug is fixed, append its entry to
[`BUGS_HISTORY.md`](BUGS_HISTORY.md); do not keep a `## Fixed` section
inline.

Readiness and graduation are not approval: before spec-governed work, present the current decision-complete digest and obtain explicit agreement in this session.

## Requires lines

**Every open bug entry carries a `**Requires:**` line** declaring what
must be in place before the fix can land. Comma-separated, same shape
as `FEATURES.md` (long lines may wrap; `/nightshift:ready` joins them before
parsing):

- A markdown link to a feature, quick win, or bug. The reference is a
  current blocker; under the walk-and-remove convention below, a
  satisfied dependency is edited out of the line at the moment it
  ships or is fixed.
- Bare text. An external primitive (driver release, vendor support,
  user decision) the user confirms case by case.
- The literal word `none.` if the fix is unblocked.

A missing `Requires:` line is a structural error. `/nightshift:ready` parses these
lines. History entries don't carry `Requires:` lines.

**When a bug is fixed**, move its entry to
[`BUGS_HISTORY.md`](BUGS_HISTORY.md) with a brief note on the fix and
the commit it landed in; drop its `Requires:` line in the move. If the
bug had its own file, keep the file in place as a historical record of
the diagnosis.

**Then walk every other `**Requires:**` line in `FEATURES.md` and
`BUGS.md`** and remove references to the just-fixed bug: if it was the
only item on the line, set the line to `Requires: none.`. Mirror of the
`FEATURES.md` walk-and-remove convention; `/nightshift:ready` never has to consult `BUGS_HISTORY.md`.

**After adding a new entry (or a bug breakout file), run `/nightshift:ready`**
from the repo root to confirm the new entry parses and its `**Requires:**`
line resolves against the real grammar in `skills/ready/ready.js`. A
malformed line (wrapped without the parser's join rule, a misplaced
`none.`, a broken or ambiguous link target, or a missing line entirely)
otherwise sits in the backlog until the next readiness pass surfaces it.

## Open

### [Feature breakout dependency lines drift from the active index](bugs/feature-breakout-dependency-drift.md)

Feature breakout files duplicate live dependency state from `FEATURES.md`, but shipped-item walks and `/nightshift:ready` update or validate only the index. Eight stale universal-MVP copies were found; three remain after cleanup in the arbitration design and agreement-gate release. Fix: the index is the sole queue authority, breakouts carry no dependency line, and `**Requires:**` is split so it holds only in-backlog links while a new optional `**External:**` line holds external primitives; `ready.js` reports a structural error naming both paths when a breakout carries either line.

**Requires:** none.

## History

Fixed bugs are archived in [`BUGS_HISTORY.md`](BUGS_HISTORY.md), loaded
on demand so the active list above stays scannable. When a bug is fixed,
append its entry there rather than to this file, AND walk every other
`**Requires:**` line in `FEATURES.md`
/ `BUGS.md`: remove the now-satisfied reference (if it was the only
one, set the line to `Requires: none.`). The active `Requires:` lines
describe what is *currently* blocking, so `/nightshift:ready` never has to consult
the history file; the dependency graph settles as bugs are fixed.
