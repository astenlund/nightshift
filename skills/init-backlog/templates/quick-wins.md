# Quick wins

Refactors ready to land when time allows; not blocking any feature, but would improve the codebase meaningfully.

This file is **one of four repo-local indexes** agents consult on demand when relevant (alongside `FEATURES.md`, `BUGS.md`, `PATTERNS.md`). Active entries are kept inline, organized under thematic `##` sections you invent as work emerges. When a quick win lands, append a shipped-note entry to [`QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md`](QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md); do not move it within this file. Negative-knowledge findings (approaches attempted and reverted) are first-class promotion candidates from the history to the relevant `.claude/patterns/<slug>.md` Cautionary tales sections.

Readiness and graduation are not approval: before spec-governed work, present the current decision-complete digest and obtain explicit agreement in this session.

Backlog prose is one paragraph or one bullet per physical line, never hard-wrapped at a column: a search hit then shows the whole entry, the parsers anchor on whole lines, and an edit shows as one changed line instead of a reflowed block. `/nightshift:ready` reports a hard-wrapped file as a notice and `/nightshift:init-backlog` unwraps it.

Capture shorthand: name the refactor, describe the current smell in a sentence or two, sketch the preferred shape. A reader should be able to start work from the entry alone. Anchor entries on identifiers that survive refactors -- symbol names, entry titles, commit hashes, config keys -- never on line numbers, plan-phase ordinals, bullet positions, or temporal qualifiers ("new", "recent"): a precise locator that rots misleads harder than a coarse one that holds.

**After adding a new entry, run `/nightshift:ready`** from the repo root to confirm it parses as a quick-wins work item against the real grammar in `skills/ready/ready.js`. Quick wins carry neither a `**Requires:**` nor an `**External:**` line; the failure mode to catch is an entry that doesn't parse as a `- ` bullet or `###` heading (ready reports it as a prose-only-section notice) while you can still fix it in the same session.

Nothing tracked yet.

## History

Implemented quick wins are archived in [`QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md`](QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md), consulted only on demand so the active backlog above stays scannable. When a quick win lands, append its entry there rather than to this file.
