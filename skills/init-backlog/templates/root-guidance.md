## Backlogs and indexes

Four repo-local indexes live under `.claude/`. Consult the relevant indexes before proposing or starting related work because a task may already be queued, designed, diagnosed, or covered by an existing pattern:

Readiness and graduation are not approval: before spec-governed work, present the current decision-complete digest and obtain explicit agreement in this session.

Backlog prose is one paragraph or one bullet per physical line, never hard-wrapped at a column: a search hit then shows the whole entry, the parsers anchor on whole lines, and an edit shows as one changed line instead of a reflowed block. `/nightshift:ready` reports a hard-wrapped file as a notice and `/nightshift:init-backlog` unwraps it.

Compatible governing-text changes that remain within the accepted digest continue autonomously after a cited contract-fit check.

When a final governing design is presented, invoke /nightshift:spec-agreement in final-presentation mode before asking for agreement.

Existing agreement is fresh only when the complete current candidate matches or passes contract-fit evaluation in the same session.

- `.claude/QUICK_WINS.md`: refactors ready to land when time allows. Shipped entries are appended to `.claude/QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md` (described below).
- `.claude/FEATURES.md`: product-level feature ideas, with one file per feature under `.claude/features/`. Shipped entries are appended to `.claude/FEATURES_HISTORY.md` (described below). When sibling feature files start duplicating shared concerns (machinery, patterns, conventions), promote an umbrella file that hosts the shared content and trim the siblings to deltas; cross-references through an umbrella scale better than pairwise cross-references.
- `.claude/BUGS.md`: known bugs awaiting fix, with one file per bug under `.claude/bugs/` when more than a few lines of description is needed. Fixed entries are appended to `.claude/BUGS_HISTORY.md` (described below).
- `.claude/PATTERNS.md`: cross-cutting design patterns that span multiple features, with one file per pattern under `.claude/patterns/`. Complementary to the umbrella-promotion heuristic above: umbrellas cluster children of one family; patterns cluster concerns that span families. A pattern graduates here when the same structure would otherwise be re-described in two or more feature files.

Four locations sit alongside the indexes and are consulted only on demand when relevant work is in flight:

- `.claude/plans/<date>-<slug>.md`: implementation plans produced by the writing-plans workflow. **Ephemeral**: a plan exists while the implementation is in flight and is deleted once the work lands. The code, tests, and commits are the durable record. Plans are purely mechanical step-by-step instructions for the agent doing the work. There is no "implemented plans" archive. Plans are never committed: in a Git repository, `.claude/plans/` is git-ignored by the repository-local `.gitignore`, independent of any track-or-ignore election for the durable backlog files.
- `.claude/QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md`: archive of shipped quick wins, split out from `QUICK_WINS.md` so the active backlog stays scannable. Append entries here as soon as the quick win lands; the file itself is consulted only when something pulls it in (a pattern-doc cross-reference, an archaeological lookup, a negative-knowledge sweep). Negative-knowledge entries (approaches attempted and reverted) are first-class promotion candidates into the relevant `.claude/patterns/<slug>.md` Cautionary tales sections.
- `.claude/FEATURES_HISTORY.md`: archive of shipped features and shipped slices, split out from `FEATURES.md` so the active backlog stays scannable. Append entries here as soon as a feature or slice lands.
- `.claude/BUGS_HISTORY.md`: archive of fixed bugs, split out from `BUGS.md`. Append entries here as soon as a bug is fixed.

**Walk-and-remove convention.** When a feature, slice, quick win, or bug-fix ships, the same change set that appends its entry to the relevant history archive ALSO walks every other `**Requires:**` line in `FEATURES.md` / `BUGS.md` and drops references to the just-shipped item; if the dropped reference was the only one on the line, the line becomes `Requires: none.`. Active `Requires:` lines therefore describe what is *currently* blocking, and `/nightshift:ready` never has to consult the history archives to resolve dependencies; the dependency graph settles as work ships.

Brainstorming output lives in feature files (or in patterns when cross-cutting / in bugs when diagnostic) rather than as separate dated specs. Pre-feature exploratory brainstorms land as draft features with `status: exploring` frontmatter and an entry in `FEATURES.md`'s `## Exploring` section; `/nightshift:ready` lists them titles-only as drafts, never in the ready set, and `/nightshift:exploring` shows the full draft list. They graduate to a themed `##` section with a `**Requires:**` line once the design firms up.

The `/nightshift:ready` skill parses each entry's `**Requires:**` line (in-backlog links only) and optional `**External:**` line (external primitives only) in `FEATURES.md` and `BUGS.md` and reports the unblocked work set. Breakout files carry neither line; the index is the sole dependency authority and the parser reports a breakout that carries one. Run it when picking what to work on next.
